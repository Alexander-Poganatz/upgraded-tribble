# upgraded-tribble
A newer version of EnvelopeBudget as a web site

## Why are you making this project?
1. I do envelope budgeting on a console app but it would be nice to have a Web UI that also works on mobile and can be hosted in a LAN
2. Do things differently than what I do at work
3. Chance to learn to implement things such as 2FA into something I use

## Technical Decisions

### Maria DB/MySQL
An easy to use database that I can get up and running on ARM64 Linux.

### C# / dotnet
I like C# and it works on Linux now, simple as.

### HTMX
Trying out a world where nice, modern looking webpages doesn't need a whole lot of custom JavaScript.
Also I don't know webpack and I don't want to learn webpack.

### Picnic.css
I wanted something simple and smaller than bootstrap that still has all the features I could use.
